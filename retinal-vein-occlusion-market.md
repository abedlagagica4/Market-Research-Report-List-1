<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retinal Vein Occlusion Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion</li><li>Central Retinal Vein Occlusion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) encompasses two primary types: Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) and Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO). BRVO occurs when a smaller retinal vein is blocked, leading to localized vision loss and fluid accumulation in the affected area. CRVO involves the blockage of the central retinal vein, potentially causing widespread vision impairment and swelling. Both conditions are associated with risk factors like hypertension and diabetes and require timely diagnosis and treatment to prevent irreversible vision damage.</p></p>
