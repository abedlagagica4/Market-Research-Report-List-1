<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Optic Cable Assembly Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Mode Fiber Optic Cable</li><li>Multi- Mode Fiber Optic Cable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fiber optic cable assembly market encompasses two primary types: single-mode and multi-mode fiber optic cables. Single-mode fiber cables feature a narrow core, allowing light to travel straight down the fiber, resulting in higher bandwidth and longer transmission distances, making them ideal for long-haul communications. In contrast, multi-mode fiber cables have a larger core, enabling multiple light modes to transmit simultaneously, suitable for shorter distances, such as within buildings or data centers. Each type serves specific networking needs based on distance and performance requirements.</p></p>
