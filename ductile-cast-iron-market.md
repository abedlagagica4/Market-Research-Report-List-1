<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ductile Cast Iron Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Molding</li><li>Horizontal Molding</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ductile cast iron is produced using two primary molding methods: vertical and horizontal molding. Vertical molding involves sand molds that are erected vertically, allowing for efficient metal flow and reduced material wastage. This method is often beneficial for larger castings. In contrast, horizontal molding involves horizontal sand molds, providing better accessibility and uniform filling, which is ideal for complex shapes and high-volume production. Both methods cater to different market needs based on production efficiency and casting specifications.</p></p>
